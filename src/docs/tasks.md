# NullInside UI Improvement Tasks

This document contains a prioritized checklist of improvement tasks for the NullInside UI project. Each task is designed to enhance code quality, performance, maintainability, or user experience.

## Architecture & Structure

1. [ ] Implement state management solution (NgRx or similar) for more predictable data flow
2. [ ] Create a comprehensive error handling strategy with centralized error service
3. [ ] Refactor services to use a common HTTP interceptor for authentication and error handling
4. [ ] Implement lazy loading for all feature modules to improve initial load time
5. [ ] Create a shared module for common components, directives, and pipes
6. [ ] Establish clear module boundaries with proper encapsulation
7. [ ] Implement proper route guards for all protected routes

## Code Quality & Maintainability

8. [ ] Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to all services, components, and interfaces
9. [ ] Implement strict TypeScript checks (enable strict mode in tsconfig.json)
10. [ ] Create interface definitions for all API responses
11. [ ] Refactor nullinside-null.service.ts to have a clear purpose or remove if unused
12. [ ] Standardize naming conventions across the codebase
13. [ ] Implement unit tests for all services with at least 80% coverage
14. [ ] Add end-to-end tests for critical user flows

## Performance Optimization

15. [ ] Implement OnPush change detection strategy for all components
16. [ ] Add proper RxJS subscription management (using takeUntil or async pipe)
17. [ ] Optimize Angular Material imports to only include used components
18. [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for any large lists
19. [ ] Add proper caching strategy for API responses
20. [ ] Optimize bundle size with code splitting and tree shaking analysis

## Security Enhancements

21. [ ] Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
22. [ ] Add XSS protection measures
23. [ ] Review and secure localStorage/sessionStorage usage
24. [ ] Implement proper CSRF protection
25. [ ] Add rate limiting for API requests
26. [ ] Audit and update dependencies for security vulnerabilities

## User Experience & Accessibility

27. [ ] Implement comprehensive loading states for all async operations
28. [ ] Add proper form validation with user-friendly error messages
29. [ ] Ensure all components are accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
30. [ ] Implement responsive design for all components
31. [ ] Add keyboard navigation support
32. [ ] Create a consistent design system with reusable components

## DevOps & CI/CD

33. [ ] Set up automated testing in CI pipeline
34. [ ] Implement automated code quality checks (linting, formatting)
35. [ ] Add bundle analysis to build process
36. [ ] Create Docker configuration for consistent development environment
37. [ ] Implement feature flags for safer deployments
38. [ ] Set up automated deployment pipeline

## Documentation

39. [ ] Create comprehensive README with setup instructions
40. [ ] Document architecture decisions and patterns
41. [ ] Add inline documentation for complex business logic
42. [ ] Create user documentation for application features
43. [ ] Document API integration points and requirements

## Twitch Bot Specific Improvements

44. [ ] Refactor Twitch bot components to use a feature module
45. [ ] Implement proper error handling for Twitch API failures
46. [ ] Add comprehensive logging for Twitch bot actions
47. [ ] Create a dashboard for Twitch bot analytics
48. [ ] Implement caching for Twitch API responses

## VM Management Improvements

49. [ ] Create a more robust VM management interface
50. [ ] Implement real-time updates for VM status changes
51. [ ] Add detailed VM resource monitoring
52. [ ] Implement batch operations for VM management
